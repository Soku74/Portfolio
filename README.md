# Portfolio
Hello there, my name is Gregory Gideon, and my email is gmgideon@my.waketech.edu. This is my GitHub account, and I will post all my current and past projects here. The repository I created here is my portfolio website. The steps 
I took to clone the repository onto the local machine was pretty easy at first; I located my files then, logged on to GitHub, made a repository there and then downloaded the GitHub app on my desktop, and moved my related files into
the repository and published it.
